Hi, I'm Fitri. 
I was a software engineer, trainer, and product analyst. 
I have over ten years of experience in software development and product management areas.

I write about programming, database, product management, and other technical contents for my clients. My experience and love of writing allow me to contribute to your project, 
whether it be technical blogs/articles or system documentations, such as backlogs/user stories, quick-start guides, and more.
 
Feel free to <a href="/contact">[contact me](/contact) to discuss how we can work together to meet your business needs.
