Welcome to my blog! --- The place where I write about the things I like, and _yeaa_... that's a lot of things! 😊
But for the most part, you'll find technical content here. 

I'm a Software Engineer with 12+ years of experience in software development and product management areas. 
I have experience in a few programming languages, software design, database development, and agile project/product management.

Hopefully, what I wrote here can also be useful for others.
