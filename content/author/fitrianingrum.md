Hi, I'm Fitri. 
I write about programming, database, product management, and other technical contents for my clients. 

I have a background in software engineering and product management for over 10 years. 
My experience and love of writing allow me to contribute to your project, whether it be technical blogs/articles or system documentation, 
such as backlogs/user stories, quick-start guides, and more.
 
Feel free to <a href="/contact">[contact me](/contact) to discuss how we can work together to meet your business needs.
