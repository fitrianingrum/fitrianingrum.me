This is 2020, and the funny thing is, I just started this blog.
Actually, I have another blog, but since I don't like its domain name, I choose to create a new one and start afresh.

Like me, you may have heard that blogging is finally dead. _But_, is it valid?

In fact, the blogging ecosystem is now mature and well established. 
Companies still invest their time, energy, and even money to produce high-quality content to create brand awareness for their business. 
Individuals still share useful content and their insights, also promote their services through blogs.

## Interesting stats

Let's look at some [interesting statistics about blogging growth](https://optinmonster.com/blogging-statistics/) below:

* The vast majority of internet users (77%) read blogs regularly.
* Every month, around 409 million people view more than 20 billion pages.
* More than 500 million blogs existed in 2019.
* Tumblr has more than 440 million blogs.
* WordPress has about 60 million blogs.
* There are approximately 1.9 billion web pages at this moment.
* Blogging has grown by 12% since 2015.

So yeah, blogging is alive, and it doesn't seem like it's going to be dead anytime soon. 
It's still totally fit in 2020 and is likely going to rise steadily for the next years.

## Microblogging platforms

There are microblogging platforms such as **Twitter**, **Instagram**, and **Pinterest** that are seen as evolutionary branches of blogging. 
You can publish short content quickly on these platforms, and it's true that it only takes minimal effort to do so. 
For instance, if you want to share a link or a short thought with your friends and followers, you can do that in a matter of seconds.

Short content is sufficient to enable you to share what book you're currently reading, a short personal thought, a funny joke, or a link to an interesting article.
However, it's not suitable for telling detailed information about something, research, or HOW-TOs (step-by-step explanations). 

So, these microblogging platforms don't compete with your blog, and you should not worry that they'll replace your blog. Instead, think of them as complementary.

## Old school blogging

If you still blog like the old days, for example, writing about your daily activities and some random posts, then your blog is not likely going to grow significantly. 
To me personally, I think that's OK if your goal is just to create a personal online journal.

However, if you want your writings to get more reads and get shared, then you need to create content that is useful for others in a compelling format.

For example, nowadays, blog posts with images or other visuals get much more views compared to those that aren't. 
Successful bloggers also create more types of content, such as podcasts, ebooks, and videos.

And to be a successful blogger, it doesn't just require good writing but also an understanding of how people nowadays consume content on the Internet.
