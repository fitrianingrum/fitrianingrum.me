You've probably heard about Scrum, which is the most popular Agile framework. 
It has been the leading framework in software project management for many years. 
This article covers the big picture of Scrum, and we'll learn the roles, events, and artifacts of Scrum, including the difference between Scrum and Agile.

Let's start by comparing Scrum and Agile.

## Scrum vs. Agile

So, are Agile and Scrum the same? 

The term Scrum is usually used interchangeably with Agile. However, they're not the same thing.  

While Agile is a mindset, philosophy, and value system as a unique approach to project work, Scrum is a framework based on Agile.

There are other popular frameworks based on Agile. Each of them has its own collection of practices while sharing the underlying Agile mindset.

Some of the other popular frameworks are:
* eXtreme Programming (XP)
* Feature-Driven Development (FDD)
* Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
* Lean Software Development (LDS)
* Crystal
* Kanban

So, _yeah_, Scrum is the most commonly used framework out there, but it is certainly not the only one. 
You can still be agile while not doing Scrum! 

## The 3 Roles of Scrum

Scrum defines the three critical roles that every Scrum team needs. 
These roles are the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the Development Team. 
When you hear people refer to the Scrum team, they're talking about all three roles at the same time.

Let's talk a _bit_ about each role. 

### Product Owner 

The Product Owner (PO) is responsible for delivering the vision of the product to the Development Team. 
They are the intermediary between the business stakeholders (or customers) and the Development Team.
 
The Product Owner is responsible for defining the work to be done. 
They set the priority of the items in the Backlog and make sure that the team works on the highest priority items first. 

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master ensures that the team follows the Scrum guidelines. 
They are also responsible for removing all impediments that can block the team from completing the goal.
However, the Scrum Master does not manage the team. They act as a facilitator for the Product Owner and the team.  

### Development Teams

The Development Teams usually consist of three to nine people in this role together. 
The size should be small enough to remain agile and large enough to finish significant work within a Sprint. 

The teams are cross-functional, which means that everyone uses all their skills to complete any task that needs to be done. 
They're also self-organizing---they determine together the best way to complete the work. 
Also, neither the PO nor the Scrum Master manages them.

## The 5 Scrum events

To stay on track, Scrum teams use these five events to keep the work moving forward:

### Sprint 
The first event you'll need to know about is the Sprint. 
The Sprint is a timebox the Scrum team uses as a development window. 
Every project consists of a series of Sprints. 

Each Sprint is a timebox lasting anywhere from one to four weeks. 
And usually, Sprints are two weeks long.

### Sprint Planning 

At the beginning of each Sprint, an event is held called Sprint Planning. 
In this planning meeting, the PO shares the highest priority items. 
Then, the Development Team selects the items that it confidently believes they can complete within the Sprint and commits to doing the work. 

### Daily Scrum

Once the Sprint begins, there is an event every day called the daily Scrum. 
All team members attend because each is providing their plan for the day. 
Every day, the team members share what they finished the day before, what they'll be doing today, and share any issues that are blocking their progress. 

### Sprint Review 

In the Sprint Review meeting, the team demonstrates everything they completed in the Sprint. 
In Scrum, when we say that something is done, we mean that it's fully completed, doesn't need to be worked on again, and is ready to be used by customers. 

The Sprint Review is meant to be informal and help the team get early feedback from the PO and stakeholders. 
It's so that they can make sure they're building a product that meets the business needs. 

### Sprint Retrospective

The final event is the Sprint Retrospective. 
This is the time the team sets aside to reflect on and adapt their internal practices, so they can improve on them. 
They'll examine what went well and what they want to improve in the next Sprint. 

## The 3 Scrum artifacts

You may have heard Scrum teams talking about their artifacts, and may have wondered what they're talking about. 
Scrum is a project framework based on transparency and feedback. 
In service to those values, Scrum defines three artifacts that are open for anyone and everyone to review:

### Product Backlog 

The first artifact is the Product Backlog. 
It is merely a list of works that could be done for the product that is sorted based on priority. 
It's a single source of work for the development team.

The PO is the one who is responsible for managing the Backlog. 
As the work progresses, items in the Backlog will be added, removed, reordered, and evolve continuously. 

### Sprint Backlog

This artifact is a subset of the Product Backlog. 
It contains the items selected from the Backlog for the current Sprint plus the Development Team's plan. 
The plan is typically a set of tasks organized by the Development Team to turn the Sprint Backlog items into a working and usable product.

### The Increment

The increment is the most crucial artifact---it is the product itself. 
Each Sprint creates an increment, which consists of the work 'done' in the Sprint plus all the work 'done' in the previous Sprints. 

The increment must be a working software with the functionalities completed so far. It should be usable and have business values. 

It doesn't matter whether the product gets deployed immediately to the market or not. 
That's the Product Owner's prerogative. However, it must be tested and verified enough to be potentially delivered. 

## Conclusion
So, now you have a basic understanding of what Scrum is. 
You also have a good foundation of the three roles, five events, and three artifacts of Scrum.

I encourage you to dive deeper to master the details better.
