You have a website, but you don't want your browsing activities on this website being collected and used by your Google Analytics account. 

If you have a static IP address, excluding your own traffic is very easy---you just need to add your IP address in the exclude filter in your Google Analytics account.

However, what if your IP address is dynamic? Or when you are traveling or working remotely? 
In such cases, it's difficult to use the same approach because you need to change the IP address in the filter every single time your IP changes.

Fortunately, there's an easy solution to exclude your dynamic IP address from Google Analytics accurately, 
which is by using the Google Analytics Opt-out Add-on. 

## Google Analytics Opt-out Add-on

This Add-on tells Google Analytics JavaScript not to send information to Google Analytics. 

You can get it from [this link](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

It is available for Microsoft Internet Explorer 11, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Opera.

To use this Add-on, install it to your browser to allow you not to send any information to your Google Analytics at all. 
After that, you need to **sign in** under your connected Google Account on your browser.
