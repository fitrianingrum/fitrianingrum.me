Everyone wants to excel at work, accomplish great things, and advance their career. 
However, things can go wrong because of the mistakes they make at work. 

Let's take a look at these common mistakes you possibly make at work and do your best to avoid them.

## 1. Not asking for help

It's always good to try to solve problems before asking for help. 
However, it's very important to know when to stop being stuck and ask for help when you need it.

It does not matter whether you're new in your job or already a senior. 
There is no single person that is skilled at everything or knows everything. So don't be embarrassed when you need help.

Asking for help might be the hardest thing for you to learn. 
Because of ego, you might think that you are showing a lack of skills or competence when you're asking for help. 

In fact, knowing how and when to ask for help is one of the most important skills you need to acquire.

## 2. Lacking initiative

Having initiative shows that you can think and do the right thing without always being told what to do.
It demonstrates a sense of self-drive and personal motivation.

When you lack initiative, you can lose motivation, be unproductive, and even miss work opportunities.

Here's an example of taking the initiative at work:

A new software developer did small refactoring on the project code without being told.
She did it regularly, and as a result, she understood the business logic quickly compared to her peers.
She could identify areas that can cause critical problems. She then reported the issues to her supervisor.
Not only that, but she also took the initiative _(again)_ to fix the problems.

A simple example above shows that a person who regularly takes the initiative can help their organization. 
Besides, they will stand out wherever they go and perform better in their career.

## 3. Showing too much initiative

Taking the initiative can be seen as both a positive and negative trait, depending on the situation.
Donald Campbell, a reasercher, referred to this as the [initiative paradox](https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/ame.2000.4468066).
Proactivity is desired, but only if it conforms exactly to the expectations of the person in charge. 
Not every initiative drives better results, but worse, it can cost the organization to lose money.

So how do you know when to take the initiative and when not to? 
Unfortunately, the answer to that is, it depends on the situation.

It's also important to know and respect the company culture. 
You need to know whether your company encourages initiative, or you need to follow a set of procedures to do so.
Understanding your environment can help prevent you from making the mistake of lacking proactiveness or showing too much.

## 4. Not respecting schedules and deadlines

Respecting schedules and deadlines shows that you care about your job and co-workers. 

Avoid regularly turning up late to meetings because it inconveniences everyone else. 
It's bad enough when you're late and even worse if the meeting is delayed because you're not there for the first part of the meeting.

Try to meet deadlines as much as possible because your deadlines might also affect your team and the organization.

To avoid being late or missing deadlines, you can learn about time management and always stay focused and organized.

## 5. Forgetting details

The difference between something good and something great is attention to detail.

Paying attention to details is the ability to achieve thoroughness and accuracy when accomplishing a task.

Nowadays, because of the fast-paced environment and high-level distractions, it can always be hard to remember details.
However, it would be best if you found ways to keep you focused and organized.

For example, when you're in a meeting and taking notes using a laptop or mobile phone, you might miss important details because of an email or a call that arrives when you're taking notes.
So, in this case, try to use a pen and paper notebook instead of a laptop.

You need to master the details to produce excellent works. It requires active listening, observation, and patience.

## 6. Gossipping and getting pulled into office drama

If you can't say anything nice, shut up.

Always be careful with your words, and be specifically cautious with written communication where your 'curses' can be shared and even broadcasted to the entire office.

Unless something impacts you directly, avoid getting involved in office drama.

## 7. Not setting goals

Have short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals for your career. 

Avoid getting trapped into day to day activities because one day you might realize that you're on a path that you didn't intend to be on or you don't enjoy.

Also, having goals can keep you motivated. When you have challenging tasks and tough days, your longer-term goals can help you get through it.
