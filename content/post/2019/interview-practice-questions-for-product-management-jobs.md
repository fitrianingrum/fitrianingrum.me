## Type of interview questions

There are several types of interview questions for product management positions. 
The interviewers may ask you about behavioral questions to know your personality, leadership, and communication skills. 
They also will ask you about specific issues related to the job you're applying, even ask technical questions. 

Here is a list of interview questions for product management jobs you might get asked. 
Of course, you won't be asked all of these questions, and likely there will be other questions that are not on this list. 
However, I hope by practicing answering the below questions, it will help you increase your confidence.

### 1. Behavioral questions

These typical questions are usually complex to answer. 
The goal of the interviewer is to know about your past experiences, personality, communication skills, leadership skills, and integrity.

* **Tell me about yourself!** It's good to practice an effective elevator pitch to answer this question.
* **Tell me about the time when... blah blah blah...**
  * Tell me about the time when you had to deal with a team member who was under-performing
  * Tell me about the time when you had to deal with a bad manager
  * Tell me about the time when you had to make a tough decision
  * Tell me about the time when you made a mistake
* **Tell me about your strengths**. It is a common question that often comes from inexperienced interviewers. Answer this question by mentioning your personal qualities that align with the job you're applying. Following is similar questions that are also asking about your strength:  
  * How do you think your teammates would describe you?
  * How would your supervisor describe your value?
* **Tell me about your weaknesses**. To answer this question, look for skills that you need to develop and answer honestly.
* **Why do you want to work here?** Explain the things about the company and the job that excite you and how would you contribute to the position. 
* **Why are you leaving your job/company?** The interviewers want to see if you have a terrible attitude by leaving your previous job and company. So the key is to focus on your career goal when answering this question. 
* **What is your biggest failure?** Uncomfortable, rite? However, be sure to answer this question. The most common mistake is not answering this question.
* **What is your most significant accomplishment?** Be sure to give examples of what you did in your last job.
* **How much salary you expect and why?** Before answering this question, make sure you do some research about the salary range for the job you're applying. 
* **How do you feel about working nights and weekends?** Do not lie and answer based on your situation with a good response.
* **Would you lie for the company?** Read [this article](https://www.livecareer.com/interview/questions/would-you-lie-for-the-company) for some example answers.

__Tips__: practice answering the above questions but remember to be yourself and be honest with your answers.

### 2. Product Management interview questions

* **What is your favorite product and why? How would you improve it?** You MUST be able to answer this question! The goal of this question is to see if you understand the products are designed to help the user accomplish something they desire to do. 
See [this article by StellarPeers](https://medium.com/stellarpeers/what-is-your-favorite-product-and-why-fc495757f1b6) for example answer.
* **You will be asked to design a product**. The goal of this question is to see how you identify the issue, organize your thought, and ask for clarifying information, and defend your answer.  
  * Design an alarm clock for the blind!
  * How would you improve Yahoo Mail?
  * How would you improve Google Maps?
* **You will be asked to estimate something**. The goal of this question is to see your ability to simplify problems and observe your performance under stress. 
  * How many ping-pong balls would fit in a helicopter?
  * How many golf balls would fit in a helicopter?
  * How many people travel every year in your country?
  * Estimate company X revenue
* **Instructional questions, for example, a question on how to make a cup of coffee**. The goal of this question is to see if you can communicate clearly and gauge your documentation skills.
Explain to the interviewer clearly and step-by-step about how to make a cup of coffee. Don't think that they already know about it. Assume they don't know how to make a cup of coffee.
